# Timezone Converter

Project deployed here https://timezone-converter.surge.sh/

This is a simple React app that allows users to convert between timezones. It uses the [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) library to handle timezone conversions. 

It also uses the [mapbox-gl](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) library to display a map of the world with timezones highlighted.

The geojson data for the map is fetched from the [timezone-converter-c658d](https://timezone-converter-c658d.web.app/combined.json) hosted in the firebase.
