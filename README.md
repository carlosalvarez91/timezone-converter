# Timezone Converter

Project deployed here https://timezone-converter-c658d.web.app/

This is a simple React app that allows users to convert between timezones. It uses the [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) library to handle timezone conversions. 

It also uses the [mapbox-gl](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) library to display a map of the world with timezones highlighted.

The geojson data that is used to display the timezones map is taken from  [timezone-boundary-builder](https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder) and I also use this library to query timezone data [countries-and-timezones](https://www.npmjs.com/package/countries-and-timezones).
